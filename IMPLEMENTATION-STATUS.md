## 🎯 Recommended Approach

### Option A: Automated Content Generation (Use AI Assistance)

Continue using `/sp.implement` or work chapter-by-chapter with Claude Code to:
1. Generate all 12 remaining chapter outlines
2. Research and gather citations for each chapter
3. Draft content section-by-section
4. Create code examples with Docker containers
5. Run quality checks

**Pros**: Faster, consistent structure, automated
**Cons**: Requires review for accuracy, may need human refinement

### Option B: Manual Authoring (Traditional Approach)

1. Complete Phase 1 manually (npm install, remaining outlines)
2. Use tasks.md as your checklist
3. Author content yourself using the outlines as guides
4. Use Claude Code for specific tasks (code examples, troubleshooting)

**Pros**: Full control, deep understanding, can customize freely
**Cons**: Slower (10-12 weeks of focused effort)

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

1. **Week 1 (Now)**: Complete Phase 1 setup tasks manually
2. **Week 2**: Use AI to generate chapter outlines and gather citations (Phase 2)
3. **Weeks 3-9**: Alternate between AI drafting and human editing per chapter
4. **Week 10**: Manual integration and review (Phase 15)
5. **Weeks 11-12**: Automated QA + manual peer review (Phases 17-18)
6. **Week 13**: Deployment and launch

**Pros**: Balanced speed and quality, leverages AI for repetitive tasks
**Cons**: Requires consistent engagement and editorial oversight

## 🚨 Known Limitations

### What Was NOT Completed

1. **Docker Base Images** (T007-T009):
   - ROS 2 Humble Docker image not built
   - Isaac Sim Docker image not built
   - These require significant time (30-60 min per image)
   - **Action**: Build when needed for code examples (Week 3+)

2. **External Accounts** (T005-T006):
   - Zotero not set up
   - Grammarly/Copyleaks accounts not created
   - **Action**: Set up before Phase 2 (Week 2)

3. **Chapter Content** (T017+):
   - Only outlines for Ch 1-2 created
   - No actual content written yet
   - No code examples created yet
   - **Action**: Main authoring effort (Weeks 2-10)

4. **Utility Scripts** (T013):
   - `scripts/check-wordcount.sh` not created
   - `scripts/validate-citations.py` not created
   - `scripts/plagiarism-check.sh` not created
   - **Action**: Create when needed (Week 11 QA phase)

---

## ✅ Success Validation

To verify Phase 1 is complete, run these checks:

### 1. Docusaurus Builds Successfully

```bash
cd book
npm install  # If not done yet
npm run build
```

**Expected**: `book/build/` directory created with HTML files

### 2. Local Preview Works

```bash
cd book
npm start
```

**Expected**: http://localhost:3000 displays the book with:
- Welcome page
- Chapters 1-2 accessible
- Sidebar navigation functional

### 3. GitHub Actions Ready

**Expected**: `.github/workflows/` contains:
- deploy-book.yml (for automatic deployment)
- check-links.yml (for link validation)

### 4. Project Structure Complete

**Expected directories**:
```bash
ls -d */
# Should show: book/ code-examples/ hardware/ course-materials/ references/ docker/ scripts/
```

---

## 📞 Next Steps

### Ready to Continue?

You have **3 options**:

1. **Continue automation**: Run `/sp.implement` again to have Claude Code continue with Phase 2 (source identification and Ch 1-2 content drafting)

2. **Manual next steps**: Complete the "Immediate Next Steps" section above yourself, then return for Phase 2

3. **Pause and review**: Review the setup, customize configurations, then resume implementation later

### Before Phase 2, Ensure:

- [ ] `npm install` completed successfully in `book/`
- [ ] Local preview (`npm start`) works
- [ ] All 14 chapter outline files created (Ch 1-2 done, need 3-14)
- [ ] GitHub repository created and pushed
- [ ] Zotero installed with Better BibTeX plugin
- [ ] Grammarly and Copyleaks accounts ready

---

**Status**: Phase 1 is **80% complete**. The foundation is ready for content authoring.

**Estimated time to complete Phase 1**: 30-60 minutes of manual setup (npm install, create remaining outlines, GitHub repo)

**Estimated time for full implementation (Phases 1-20)**: 10-12 weeks of consistent effort (~15-20 hours/week)
