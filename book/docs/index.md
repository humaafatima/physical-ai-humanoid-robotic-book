# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## From Simulated Digital Twins to Conversational Embodied Agents

Welcome to the open-source book and capstone course on building conversational humanoid robots using ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and Vision-Language-Action models.

### What You'll Learn

This comprehensive guide teaches you to:

- **Use ROS 2** for real-time robotic control
- **Build digital twins** in Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- **Implement GPU-accelerated perception** with Isaac ROS
- **Design autonomous navigation** with Nav2 for bipedal robots
- **Integrate Vision-Language-Action models** for embodied AI
- **Create voice-controlled robots** using Whisper + LLMs + ROS 2
- **Deploy sim-to-real transfer** techniques for physical hardware

### Course Structure

This book contains **14 chapters** covering the complete pipeline from ROS 2 basics through deployed conversational humanoid systems:

1. **Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence**
2. **The Humanoid Robotics Landscape (2025)**
3. **ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System**
4. **URDF & Robot Modeling for Humanoids**
5. **Digital Twins – Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim**
6. **Sensor Simulation and Real-World Integration**
7. **NVIDIA Isaac ROS – Accelerated Perception and VSLAM**
8. **Navigation and Bipedal Locomotion with Nav2**
9. **Vision-Language-Action Models (VLA) for Robotics**
10. **From Voice to Action – Whisper + LLM + ROS 2 Planning**
11. **Manipulation and Dexterous Grasping**
12. **Sim-to-Real Transfer Techniques**
13. **Capstone Project – Autonomous Conversational Humanoid**
14. **Hardware Guide & Lab Architectures**

### Target Audience
